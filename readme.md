# Token HUD Artwork Button
This module adds a button to the token or tile HUD that opens the target actor's artwork, or their token artwork on right-click. Hold the shift key to automatically show to everyone.

It also adds shortcut keybindings:
- Shift+Z: Show Tile/Token to everyone.
- Shift+X: Show token Actor's artwork to everyone.
- Add an Alt to either to show only yourself.
- Only the GM can show to everyone.
